.B emu reset
[\-\-help] [\-\-version] [\-V] [\-n] [\-v] [\-p] [\-f]
          [<stack>:]<snapshot>
.SH DESCRIPTION
Resets the contents of a snapshot to the source directory and stack HEAD. This
means that all snapshot pushed after the given <snapshot> will be discarded.
.PP
If you have a stack with a set of sequential snapshot [A\->B\->C], running reset
against snapshot A will reset the source to snapshot A and discard snapshots B
and C, effectively re\-winding time.
