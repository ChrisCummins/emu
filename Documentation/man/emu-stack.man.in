.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
.nf
\fIemu stack\fR      [\-\-help] [\-\-version] [\-v] [\-q]
\fIemu stack\fR add  [\-s <number>] <stack> <path>
\fIemu stack\fR rm   <stack>
\fIemu stack\fR mv   <old> <new>
\fIemu stack\fR show <stack>
.SH DESCRIPTION
With no arguments, show a list of existing stacks. Alternatively, use one of the
following subcommands.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\-\-help
show this help and quit
.TP
\-\-version
show version information
.TP
\-v
increase verbosity
.TP
\-q
quiet mode. Suppress non\-error messages
.TP
add <stack> <path>
initializes an empty stack named <stack> in the directory <path>. This means
creating a .emu directory at <path> with subdirectories for trees, refs/nodes
and configuration files. If necessary, <path> will be created. Each stack <stack>
must be unique, and each <path> must not already be an emu stack/source, unless
it is a detached stack. A detached stack means that it refs the current source,
but the current source does not acknowledge it as a stack. This happens if you
attempt to add a stack that has previously be removed with 'emu rm'. In this
situation, 'emu add' will behave the same way that 'emu init' does in an
existing source. Additionally the command takes the following options:
.TP
\-s <number>
set the maximum size of the new stack, as a number of snapshots. This
value can be set at any time by editing the "Max number" key in the
"Snapshots" section of the config file.
.TP
rm <stack>
remove stack <stack> from the source refs. This does not affect the stackSTACKe
structure and is non\-destructive, except with the use of arguments:
.TP
    \-R
force removal of the stack directory itself. This means that all snapshots,
configurations and all other files in the stack directory will be permanently
wiped. Use with extreme caution, double up to be safe
.TP
mv <old> <new>
rename stack <old> to <new>. This does not affect any of the location of the stack
or its files
.TP
show <stack>
prints some information about the stack <stack>
