.SH NAME
emu\-clean \- remove locks and orphaned data from sources and sinks
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B emu clean
[<options>] [<sink ...>]
.SH DESCRIPTION
If an emu action upon a sink or source fails, is remotely killed or
exits unexpectedly, the sink or source can be left in an unclean
state. This may affect the outcome of future actions, prevent emu from
operating normally or just result in temporary data being left in
an 'orphaned' state.
.PP
This command searches for these unwanted files and locks, and forcibly

clean state.
