.SH NAME
emu\-verify \- Verify the contents of snapshots
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B emu verify
[<options>] [<stack>[:<snapshot>] ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Verifies snapshot checksums by computing against the stored tree. A
checksum which does not match is indicative of a snapshot that is in
some way corrupted or has been tampered with.
.PP
The format for specifying snapshots is in the form
<stack>[:<snapshot>]. The <snapshot> value is the 40 digit snapshot
ID, and can be obtained from 'emu log'. If omitted, all of the
snapshots within a stack will be verified. If no snapshot or stack is
specified, every stack will be verified.
.PP
Verification uses the same checksum algorithm which was used to
generate the snapshot ID. The results of verification are cached in
the snapshot node.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\-\-cached
Use cached values from a previous verification where available,
instead of computing new checksums.
.TP
\-S <dir> \-\-source-dir <dir>
Specify the directory to use as an emu source. Defaults to `.'.
.TP
\-v \-\-verbose
Increase verbosity.
.TP
\-\-version
Show version information and quit.
.TP
\-h \-\-help
Show this help and quit.
.SH EXAMPLES

.TP
