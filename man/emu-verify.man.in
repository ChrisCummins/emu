.SH NAME
emu\-verify \- Verify the contents of snapshots
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B emu verify
[<options>] [<sink>[:<snapshot>] ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Verifies snapshot checksums by computing against the stored tree. A
checksum which does not match is indicative of a snapshot that is in
some way corrupted or has been tampered with.
.PP
The format for specifying snapshots is in the form
<sink>[:<snapshot>]. The <snapshot> value is the 40 digit snapshot
ID, and can be obtained from 'emu log'. If omitted, all of the
snapshots within a sink will be verified. If no snapshot or sink is
specified, every sink will be verified.
.PP
Verification uses the same checksum algorithm which was used to
generate the snapshot ID. The results of verification are cached in
the snapshot node.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\-\-dont-cache

.TP
\-\-use-cached

.TP
\-S <dir> \-\-source-dir <dir>
Specify the directory to use as an emu source. Defaults to `.'.
.TP
\-v \-\-verbose
Increase verbosity.
.TP

.TP
\-h \-\-help
Show this help and quit.
.SH EXAMPLES
