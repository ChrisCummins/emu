.SH DESCRIPTION
This is a destructive from of the
.B emu-peek
(1) command. It resets the contents of a snapshot to the source directory, and
discards all snapshots on the stack more recent than the restored one.
.PP
If you have a stack consisting of a set of sequential snapshot [A\->B\->C],
popping snapshot B will discard snapshot C, restoring the working directory to
snapshot B, leaving the stack in the state [A\->B].
