.SH NAME
emu\-push \- record source snapshots
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B emu push
[<options>] [<stack> ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Push a new snapshot of the source directory onto one or more
stacks. If none are specified, push to all stacks.
.PP
The difference between the source and a stack's HEAD is transferred
and linked against the existing content, combining to produce a full
snapshot of the source directory. This enables emu stacks to be very
compact, allowing multiple full snapshots to be stored in a space
little larger than a single full snapshot.
.PP
Some of the features of snapshot creation are:
.IP \[bu]
supports copying links, devices, owners, groups, and permissions
.IP \[bu]
exclude and exclude\-from options
.IP \[bu]
does not require super\-user privileges
.PP
Emu uses the
.B rsync
(1) file\-copying tool for its delta\-transfer
algorithm, which reduces the amount of data sent by sending only the
differences between the source files and the existing files in the
stack. Rsync finds files that need to be transferred using a "quick
check" algorithm that looks for files that have changed in size or in
last\-modified time.
.SH OPTIONS
\-d \-\-dry-run
Perform a trial run with no changes made.
.TP
\-f \-\-force
Force push the snapshot, ignoring any concurrency locks on the source
or stack.
.TP
\-v \-\-verbose
Increase verbosity.
.TP
\-\-version
Show version information and quit.
.TP
\-h \-\-help
Show this help and quit.
