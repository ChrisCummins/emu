INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS for emu version 0.0.3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For most users, entering the following command at a terminal from this directory
will perform all the necessary installation tasks:

    $ sudo make install && make check

DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Emu consists of several modules, i.e., the executables, the library, the shared
files, and the documentation. There are make install/uninstall rules for each of
these. Consult the make help for further information:

    $ make help

To install all of the emu modules simultaneously, execute 'make install' as the
root user. This will install all of the program files and executables in the
filesystem, under the /usr/local prefix. At this point in time there is no
support for installing emu in other directories (patches and pull requests
welcome!).

Emu comes with a test suite which can be executed using 'make check'. Emu must
be installed first. NOTE that some of the tests require root permissions, these
are granted using the sudo package, so you may be prompted for your sudo
password.
